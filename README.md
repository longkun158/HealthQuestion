# Principal Components Analysis and Factor Analysis

## Abstract: 

The **health.csv** data set is made up of 15 self-reported health items for a study conducted by Tobinco Health Advisors. Participants were required to answer questions on a scale from 1 to 20. With 1 indicating a very negative response to  the question and 20 being a very positive response to the question. They also collected information on the Type of diet and Body type of the 450 subjects. 

## Key findings:

- The differences in diet type based on the answer to 15 questions are not large

- The differences in body type based on the answer are noticeable:

+   Ectomorph body type answered highly on average for the first five questions, meaning on average, they find themselves physically fit enough

+   Endomorph body type answered highly on average for questions 6 - 10, meaning on average, they find themselves heathy mentally.

+   Mensomoprh body type answered highly on average for questions 11 - 15, meaning that on average, they find meaning connections and are socially accepted.

- With Principle Component Analysis, the difference in the three groups' answers is visible.

- With Factor Analysis, there are two latent factors: ML2 (questions 1 - 5) indicating physical health, and ML1 (question 6-15) indicating mental health and social connections
