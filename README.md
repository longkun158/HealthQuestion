# Principal Components Analysis and Factor Analysis

## Abstract: The **health.csv** data set is made up of 15 self-reported health items for a study conducted by Tobinco Health Advisors. Participants were required to answer questions on a scale from 1 to 20. With 1 indicating a very negative response to  the question and 20 being a very positive response to the question. They also collected information on Type of diet and Body type of the 450 subjects. 

## Key findings:

- The differences in diet type based in the answer of 15 questions are not large

- The differences in body type based in the answer are noticeable:

+   Ectomoprh body type answered highly in average for the first five questions, meaning in average, they find themselves are physically fit enough

+   Endomoprh body type answered highly in average for the question 6 - 10, meaning in average, they find themselves are heathy mentally.

+   Mensomoprh body type answered highly in average for the question 11 - 15, meaning in average, they find meaning connections and socially accepted.

- With Principle Component Analysis, the difference in the answers between three groups are visible.

- With Factor Analysis, there are two latent factors: ML2 (question 1 - 5) indicating physical health and ML1 (question 6-15) indicating mental health and social connections
